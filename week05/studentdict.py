# Write a program that will read in the data for the data structure above, ie reads in a studentâ€™s name, 
#then keeps reading in their modules and grades(until the user enters a blank module name), You can break this up into two parts:
#a. Just read in the module names until the user enters blank, b. Then read in the grade as well
#b. This program can just read in one student (and their module details).
#6. If you want to go a step further, read in multiple students (until the student_name is blank.
